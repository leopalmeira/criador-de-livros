# Changelog

All notable changes to Book Generator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned for v1.1
- Enhanced editing workflow with AI revision suggestions
- Multiple book format support (technical, fiction, non-fiction templates)
- Collaborative authoring features
- Version control integration for manuscripts

### Planned for v1.2
- Direct Amazon KDP API integration
- Automated cover design generation
- Marketing copy generation (description, keywords, categories)
- Multi-language book generation

### Planned for v2.0
- Full publishing pipeline automation (draft → edited → formatted → published)
- Analytics dashboard for sales tracking
- Author community platform
- AI-powered reader feedback analysis

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-01

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes

#### Added
- `scripts/generate_book.sh` — master orchestrator chaining the full 6-step pipeline
  (outline → chapters → appendices → references → plagiarism check → compile)
- `requirements.txt` — runtime Python dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`)
- `.env.example` — template for API keys and optional defaults

#### Fixed
- Model override (`--model` / `-m` flag) was silently ignored; now correctly pins Gemini
  models via temp `GEMINI_MODELS` override and Ollama models via direct API call
  (`scripts/multi_provider_ai_simple.sh`)
- Removed ~70 lines of unreachable dead code in `generate_book_cover()` that followed
  an early `return 0` (`scripts/compile_book.sh`)
- `demo.sh` existence check pointed to `./generate_book.sh`; corrected to
  `./scripts/generate_book.sh`
- Two BATS tests in `tests/generator.bats` pointed to `./generate_book.sh`; corrected
  to `./scripts/generate_book.sh`

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-15

### 🎉 Proof-of-Concept Complete

Book Generator has successfully demonstrated feasibility by producing **books on Amazon KDP**
using a fully Bash-based pipeline driven by multi-provider AI (Gemini, Groq, Ollama).

### Achievements

**Published Books (v3/ pipeline):**
- Full-length manuscripts (50,000+ words) generated end-to-end via shell scripts
- Amazon KDP formatting compliance
- Cover design integrated via ImageMagick (`generate_book_cover()`)
- Metadata and keyword optimization workflow

**Validation:**
- ✅ Full manuscript generation
- ✅ Chapter structure and organisation
- ✅ PDF, EPUB, HTML, MOBI output via Pandoc + ImageMagick
- ✅ Multi-provider AI fallback (Gemini → Groq → Ollama)
- ✅ Plagiarism detection pass per chapter

### Core Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/generate_book.sh` | Master orchestrator — full pipeline in one command |
| `scripts/multi_provider_ai_simple.sh` | AI provider abstraction + all generation functions |
| `scripts/compile_book.sh` | Assembles chapters → PDF / EPUB / HTML / MOBI |
| `scripts/generate_appendices.sh` | AI-generated appendices (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`) |
| `scripts/generate_references.sh` | AI-generated bibliography (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`) |
| `scripts/generate_covers.sh` | Standalone cover generation utility |
| `scripts/kdp_topic_finder.sh` | KDP market research and topic discovery |
| `scripts/plagiarism_report_manager.sh` | Plagiarism report utilities |

### AI Provider Priority

1. **Gemini** (if `GEMINI_API_KEY` set) — primary provider, model rotation via `GEMINI_MODELS` array
2. **Ollama** — local fallback, model array with priority order
3. **Groq** — cloud fallback

### Known Limitations

1. **Human Editing Required** — AI generates high-quality drafts; final polish is manual
2. **Cover Design via ImageMagick** — B&W programmatic covers; AI image covers require `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. **KDP Upload Manual** — no API integration yet
4. **Appendices/References** require Gemini API key (Ollama path not implemented)

### Technical Dependencies

- Bash 4+ (macOS: `brew install bash`)
- Pandoc (PDF/EPUB/HTML/MOBI compilation)
- ImageMagick (cover generation)
- `jq` (JSON parsing for AI responses)
- Python 3.9+ with `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` (optional tooling)
- At least one AI provider key or local Ollama running

## [0.3.0] - 2024-10-01

### Added
- Multi-format export (PDF, EPUB, MOBI) via Pandoc
- Amazon KDP formatting utilities
- Cover image generation via ImageMagick

### Changed
- Improved chapter generation prompts for better consistency
- Enhanced outline structure with hierarchical chapters
- Better error handling in pipeline scripts

## [0.2.0] - 2024-08-15

### Added
- Chapter-by-chapter generation workflow
- Multi-provider AI fallback (Gemini → Ollama)
- Word count tracking per chapter
- Plagiarism check integration

### Fixed
- API rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Chapter ordering and accumulation logic

## [0.1.0] - 2024-06-01

### Added
- Initial proof-of-concept
- Basic outline generation
- Single chapter generation
- Simple text compilation
- README documentation

### Notes
- First working prototype

## Future Vision

The goal is to evolve Book Generator from a proof-of-concept into a **full-featured AI-assisted authoring platform** that:

1. **Democratizes Publishing** - Make book creation accessible to everyone
2. **Maintains Quality** - Ensure AI-generated content meets human standards
3. **Automates Tedium** - Handle formatting, metadata, and distribution logistics
4. **Empowers Creativity** - Let authors focus on ideas, not mechanics
5. **Builds Community** - Connect AI-assisted authors for learning and support

**Disclaimer:** This tool assists in content generation but does not replace human creativity, editing, and oversight. All AI-generated content should be reviewed, fact-checked, and refined before publication.
